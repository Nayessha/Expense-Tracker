# Personal Expense Tracker (C++)

A console-based **Personal Expense Tracker** developed in **C++** that helps users record, store, and manage daily expenses.  
The application uses **file handling** to ensure data persistence and follows a **modular, structured project layout** similar to real-world software projects.

This project was built as a **second-year CSE resume project** to strengthen core programming concepts and Git-based workflow.
